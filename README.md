# Competitive Altruism Power Analysis

## Instructions for power analysis

The power analysis should help us to predict whether differences between dyadic and triadic offers are significantly reliable as a function of:

* the number of trials administered
* the number of individuals (and formed triads) that participate

## Expectations:

### Individuals 

We will conduct this power analysis only for the A chimpanzee group.
I expect to test 6 chimpanzees (minimum expected to start study is 3, realistic maximum is 8).

Ages of the individuals that could participate: **28yo (Sandra), 27yo (Frodo), 18yo** (Tai), 45yo (Robert), 40yo (Dorien), 45yo (Fraukje), 17yo (Kisha), 20yo (Bambari). In bold those that I really count with.

If 6 individuals participate, I expect to create 6 unique triads. The idea is that each individual will participate twice as proposer and once as responder. 
If 4 individuals participate, I will try to create 4 unique triads so that each individual can still participate twice as proposer and once as responder.


Taking 6 individuals and 6 tryads as the most common outcome, I will perform a total of 768 trials.
Each triad will participate in 16 sessions (128 trials). There are no role changes within the 16 sessions.
Each session will present 8 consecutive or simultaneous trials.

### Variables

**Dyadic/Triadic condition**. Each triad will participate in 8 triadic sessions and in 8 dyadic sessions. We will alternate each type of session until we complete the 16 sessions.
  During triadic sessions the two proposers will make an offer to a responder.
  During dyadic sessions each proposer will make offers separately, while the other proposer will not be able to access the apparatus.

  In triadic sessions, 8 triadic trials separated in two blocks: consecutive and simultaneous trials (see below). Block order changes between sessions.
  In dyadic sessions, 8 dyadic trials separated in two blocks: four dyadic trials per proposer, one after the other. Block order changes between sessions.
  Always same responder within sessions (for the entire 16 sessions).
  
**Consecutive/Simultaneous condition**. Within triadic sessions, we will separate trials in two blocks containing simultaneous or consecutive trials. Only during simultaneous trials both proposers make an offer at the same time. Within consecutive trials, each proposer is first in two of the four trial blocks.

**Experience phase**. Assuming 6 individuals and 6 total triads, we expect that each individuals would participate in 3 triads, twice as proposer and once as responder.
  ABC design to test whether changes of partner (proposer and responder), affects individuals' strategies. 
  
  
  ***Alternative to also assess: It would be nice if we could manipulate whether only proposer changes and only responder changes. For example, with 6 individuals there would        be 4 proposers and 2 responders so that each proposer can be tested with different responder only, different proposer only or both different (e.g. A prop, B prop, C resp/      A prop, E prop, C resp/ A prop B prop F resp and A prop, D prop and F resp). This will create a total of 8 distinct triads.***
