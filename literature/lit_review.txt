Not sure if it will be of much help but this four studies are the best I found after an extensive search. They are all about UG in humans with multi proposers.
In Fischbacher study this is just one of the conditions PC2, the others involve multi responder with one proposer.
The stats of the studies are quite basic (Wilcox, t-tests, etc) but I guess the main difference is that in the chimpanzee study there are repeated observations whereas here that is almost never the case (with the exception of the first Otto study)
