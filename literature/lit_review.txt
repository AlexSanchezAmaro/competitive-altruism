Literature review on multi-proposer UG studies (humans)

Not sure if it will be of much help but this four studies are the best I found after an extensive search.

In Fischbacher, the multi proposer condition is PC2, the other conditions involve multi responder with one proposer.
The stats of the studies are quite simple (Wilcox, t-tests, etc) but I guess the main difference is that while in the chimpanzee study there are repeated observations, in these papers that is almost never the case (with the exception of the first Otto study)
